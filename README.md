# Decentralized_Finance_Blockchain
Goal of this project is to build a blockchain-based ledger system. A webpage is going to be created using streamlit. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

# Technologies
The program is written using Visual Studio code. The program lays out a step-wise reporting and program execution. The code is run in a (Dev) environment with the use of the following libraries:

streamlit

dataclasses

typing

datatime

pandas

hashlib

# Usage

Data is entered into the blockchain thru a streamlit web interface:

Data is then added to the Pychain Blockchain:
